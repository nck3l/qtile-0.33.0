  Simple-ish qtile configs that appear to have 3 bars that can float by uncommenting the margins as the bottom of the "Screen" definition, Scratchpads (terminal, an ncmpcpp player, and lf file manager), and color themes stolen directly from DistroTube (https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/tree/master/.config/qtile?ref_type=heads).
  The configs require Nerd Fonts (https://www.nerdfonts.com/#home).
  
  Ver. 1 is just a straight bar, like in dwm.

  Ver. 2 uses the qtile-extras package to make decorations for the bar, which can cause problems when it and the qtile package are out of sync.

  Ver. 3 looks identical, but it uses text boxes and icons to achieve the same decoration effects.

  The wallpaper is not available, but it is an astro-photograph that a friend took of the Rho Ophiuchi Region on 26 Jul 2025.
