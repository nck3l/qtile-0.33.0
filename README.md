Simple-ish qtile configs that appears to have 3 pill-shaped bars, thanks to transparency, spacers, and know how.
The require Nerd Fonts (https://www.nerdfonts.com/#home).
The far left widget loads a random wallpaper at startup and every time it is clicked.

Ver. 2 uses the qtile-extras package, which can cause problems when it and the qtile package are out of sync.

Ver. 3 looks identical, but it uses text boxes and icons to achieve the same pill-shape effect.

:wq ;)
